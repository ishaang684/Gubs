Online Version of a card game called Gubs

gubs.netlify.app - to play the game in your browser

Double click to draw a card, you can drag the cards around the screen to simulate playing Gubs in real life.


Current bugs:
- The Image for the Dangerous Alchemy Card isn't correct
- If two cards are perfectly on top of each other, there's no way to seperate them
- You can double click anywhere instead of having to click on the deck to draw a card
- Can lose cards by dragging them out of the screen



Plans for future:
- show instructions on how to play the game
- hovering over a card shows an enlarged version of the card
- Discard pile that you can drag cards to
- Multiplayer, people can create/join rooms to play gubs together.
